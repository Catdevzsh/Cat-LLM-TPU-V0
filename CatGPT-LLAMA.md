Installation
Prerequisites
TPU hardware access (Google Cloud TPU recommended)
Python 3.7 or higher
Virtual environment tools (e.g., venv, virtualenv)
Steps
Clone the repository:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Catdevzsh/Cat-LLM-TPU-V0.git
cd Cat-LLM-TPU-V0
Create a virtual environment:

sh
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install dependencies:

sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up TPU environment:
Follow the Google Cloud TPU setup guide to configure your TPU environment.

Usage
Training a Model
To train a language model on TPU, use the following command:

sh
Copy code
python train_model.py --config configs/config.yaml
Evaluating a Model
To evaluate a trained model, use:

sh
Copy code
python evaluate_model.py --config configs/config.yaml --checkpoint checkpoints/model.ckpt
Inference
For inference using a trained model:

sh
Copy code
python inference.py --config configs/config.yaml --input data/input.txt --output data/output.txt
